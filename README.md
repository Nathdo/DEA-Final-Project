# DEA Final Project â€“ Efficiency Analysis of Academic Institutions in Israel

This project evaluates the efficiency of academic institutions in Israel using **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)**. By comparing multiple universities and colleges across the country, we aim to identify how effectively institutions transform resources (expenses, staff, research funding, etc.) into outcomes (students, research impact, income, alumni success).

## Objectives

- Measure efficiency using DEA models (CRS and VRS)
- Analyze trends in performance from 2014 to 2021
- Identify institutions with high or low efficiency
- Support decision-making for policymakers and academic managers

## Methodology

- **Method**: Data Envelopment Analysis (non-parametric)
- **Tools**: Python (with `Benchmarking`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`)
- **Models**: Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) and Variable Returns to Scale (VRS)
- **Inputs**: Expenses, staff numbers, salaries, etc.
- **Outputs**: Number of students, income, research citations, alumni value

## Institutions Analyzed

- **7 Universities** (e.g., Tel Aviv, Technion, Hebrew University)
- **9 Engineering Colleges** (e.g., Afeka, ORT Braude, Shenkar)

## Future Plans

- Build an open-source dashboard (AcaData.com)
- Integrate anomaly detection and data tracking
- Publish results in academic conferences (e.g., ITISE 2025)
- Collaborate with institutions internationally

## Structure

- `DEA_scripts/`: Python files for DEA experiments
- `Data/`: Cleaned institutional datasets
- `Plots/`: Visualizations of efficiency scores
- `Presentation/`: Mid-term slides and documentation

## Team

- Shiri Ben Eliyahu
